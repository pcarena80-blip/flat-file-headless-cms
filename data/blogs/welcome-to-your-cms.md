# Welcome to Your Flat-File Headless CMS! 🚀

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your own flat-file headless CMS powered by GitHub and Netlify. This demo blog post will help you understand how everything works.

## What You Can Do

### ✨ Create Blog Posts
- Write content in Markdown format
- Add titles, excerpts, and tags
- Set featured posts
- Schedule publication dates

### 🔐 User Management
- Sign up with your email
- Secure login system
- User-specific content management

### 📁 GitHub Storage
- All content stored as `.md` files on GitHub
- Version control for all your content
- No database required!

## How It Works

This CMS uses a unique approach where:

1. **Content Storage**: All blog posts and user data are stored as Markdown files in your GitHub repository
2. **GitHub API**: The system uses GitHub's API to read, write, and manage content
3. **Netlify Functions**: Serverless functions handle authentication and content management
4. **Static Hosting**: Your site is served from Netlify's global CDN

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Blog Post
1. Go to the **Admin Panel**
2. Click **"Add New Blog"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Title**: Your blog post title
   - **Excerpt**: A brief summary
   - **Content**: Write your blog post in Markdown
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags (optional)

### 2. Markdown Features
You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Code snippets`
- Lists like this one
- And much more!

### 3. Content Management
- Edit existing posts
- Delete posts you no longer need
- Set featured posts for homepage
- Organize with tags

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
your-repo/
├── blogs/

└── functions/
    ├── auth.js
    ├── blogs.js
    └── github-api.js
```

### Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token
- `GITHUB_OWNER`: Your GitHub username
- `GITHUB_REPO`: Your repository name
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Customize the design** by editing the CSS files
2. **Add more features** like comments or categories
3. **Set up a custom domain** for your site
4. **Invite other users** to contribute
