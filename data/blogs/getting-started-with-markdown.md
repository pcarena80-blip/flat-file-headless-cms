# Getting Started with Markdown üìù

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes writing content easy and beautiful. In this guide, you'll learn how to use Markdown in your CMS.

## Basic Formatting

### Headers
Use `#` for headers:
```markdown
# Main Header
## Sub Header
### Section Header
```

### Text Formatting
- **Bold text**: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- *Italic text*: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- `Code`: Use backticks for inline code
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~strikethrough~~`

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 2.1
  - Sub-item 2.2
- Item 3
```

**Ordered lists:**
```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

## Advanced Features

### Links
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Images
```markdown
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

### Code Blocks
```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Blockquotes
> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or quotes.

### Tables
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |

## Tips for Better Writing

1. **Use headers** to organize your content
2. **Keep paragraphs short** for better readability
3. **Use lists** to break down complex information
4. **Include code examples** when relevant
5. **Add images** to make your posts more engaging

## Examples in Action

Here's how you might structure a technical blog post:

### Introduction
Start with a clear introduction that explains what the reader will learn.

### Main Content
Break your content into logical sections using headers.

### Code Examples
```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

result = calculate_sum(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Conclusion
End with a summary or call to action.

## Best Practices

- **Preview your content** before publishing
- **Use descriptive link text** instead of "click here"
- **Keep formatting consistent** throughout your post
- **Test your links** to make sure they work
- **Use appropriate tags** to help readers find your content

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to close bold/italic tags**
2. **Using too many headers** (don't go deeper than H3)
3. **Not using lists** when you have multiple related items
4. **Inconsistent formatting** throughout the post

## Ready to Write?

Now that you understand Markdown, you're ready to create amazing blog posts! Remember:

- Start simple and add complexity as needed
- Use the preview feature to check your formatting
- Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles

Happy writing! ‚úçÔ∏è
